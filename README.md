## RAGPDFCHAT 
uses RAG architecture to extract text from a PDF chunk and store it as vectors and retrieve them to provide a well generated answer as an AI Chatbot (GPT2) 

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Accurate text extraction from PDF documents using PyMuPDF
- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant content using sentence transformers and cosine similarity
- **Intelligent Q&A**: Answers questions using GPT-2 with context from your documents
- **Persistent Memory**: ChromaDB vector database maintains knowledge between sessions
- **Advanced NLP**: Lemmatization, query expansion, and contextual understanding
- **Interactive CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line interface
